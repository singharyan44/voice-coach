# Voice Coach — Slide Outline (mandatory PDF, <5 min talk)

## Slide 1 — Title
Voice Coach: an adaptive communication-training agent.
Tagline: "Practice. Diagnose. Retry. Measure. Adapt."
Demo URL + repo URL + team.

## Slide 2 — Problem
Generic speaking tips don't change behavior ("be confident").
Existing tools rate you; none *train* you through repeated attempts.
Interview pipelines leak strong candidates over weak delivery.

## Slide 3 — Solution: the training loop
Challenge → Speak → Observe → Diagnose → Coach → Retry →
Measure improvement → Adapt the next challenge.
Diagram: three coaches (Speech / Debate / Interview) over one TrainingEngine.

## Slide 4 — Live demo map (mirror DEMO.md)
Sample → feedback with measured metrics → retry → comparison →
assigned drill → debate attack → diagnosis → profile update.

## Slide 5 — Technology (AssemblyAI-forward)
Universal-3.5 Pro Streaming, temp-token auth, turn/end-of-turn semantics,
word-timing pause detection, clean Terminate lifecycle. LLM layer
(Groq/OpenRouter) for reasoning; deterministic engines for numbers.
Screenshot: system status line + feedback panel.

## Slide 6 — Originality
Not a rater, not a sparring chatbot: the product is the *adaptive loop*.
Weakest-skill assignment, opponent that attacks YOUR argument, personal
profile that compounds. Truthful fallback badges (never fake AI output).

## Slide 7 — Business value
Freemium learners → coach/bootcamp seats → HR screening at scale.
Moat: per-user training profile + adaptive curriculum data.

## Slide 8 — Future
Negotiation/teaching/leadership scenarios, video-aware coaching (spiked),
team dashboards, mobile app.

## Slide 9 — Ask / close
Repo + demo QR codes. "Try the samples — no mic needed."
